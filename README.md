# EDA-structuring-with-Python
### Introduction
Throughout this notebook, we will practice structuring data in Python. Before getting started, watch the associated instructional video and complete the in-video question. All of the code we will be implementing and related instructions are contained in this notebook.

### Overview
In this notebook, we will examine lightning strike data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) for the year of 2018. To complete this notebook, we will:

* Find the locations with the greatest number of strikes within a single day
* Examine the locations that had the greatest number of days with at least one lightning strike
* Determine whether certain days of the week had more lightning strikes than others
* Add data from 2016 and 2017 and, for each month, calculate the percentage of total lightning strikes for that year that occurred in that month
* Plot this data on a bar graph
